VERSION #5 :    

-Http Deprecated, HttpClient Here to Stay:  JSON is an assumed default  - Interceptors allow middleware logic to be inserted into the pipeline - Progress events

-Multiple Export Alias:    exportAs:'dashboard, logBoard'
             
-Improved Decorator: WITH useValue, useFactory, and data : a lambda can be used instead of a named function like so:  provider: [{provide: 'token', useFactory: () => null}]

-Forms Validation: forms now have the ability to decide when the validity and value of a field or form are updated via on blur or on submit, instead of every input event:
  <input name="nickName" ngModel [ngModelOptions]="{updateOn: 'blur'}">
  <form [ngFormOptions]="{updateOn: 'submit'}">
   In the case of Reactive forms:
   ngOnInit() {
     this.newUserForm = this.fb.group({
    userName: ['Bob', { updateOn: 'blur', validators: [Validators.required] }]
     });}
     
-Animations in Angular 5: new transition aliases, :increment and :decrement
-New Router Lifecycle Events in Angular 5: GuardsCheckStart, ChildActivationStart, ActivationStart, GuardsCheckEnd, ResolveStart, ResolveEnd, ActivationEnd, and ChildActivationEnd
-Better Support for Service Workers in Angular 5: @angular/service-worker
