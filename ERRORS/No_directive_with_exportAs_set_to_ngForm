///////// how to solve the error "No directive with exportAs set to ngForm" while using Angular 7 :

While declaring a variable on the View, to reference the Template Driven Form that we designed there, we would face an error , 
at the moment Angular tries to assign the ngForm Directive to the template variable.

The error just states "No directive with exportAs set to ngForm":

The cause of the error is quite simple. Indeed, the error message states the problem specifically : 
"No directive with exportAs set to ngForm".

Remember that ngForm is a Directive . Also, you know that if you code a Directive, you must decorate it with the "export" word.  
Therefore, Angular has not found the corresponding Directive, to bind it to the Template.

In other words : "I could'nt find an ngForm directive with an 'export' definition".

So that we do is to open the Module where your Component was declared,         <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
let's say the app.module for example, 
and IMPORT there the FormsModule class, which is in '@angular/forms' .     <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

The FormsModule class, as stated in its definitions, has as its objective to "Exports the required providers 
and directives for template-driven forms".

After you add this module in the "imports" section, delete and add again the Template variable, and the error will dissapear.
