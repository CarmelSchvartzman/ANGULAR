Services should be stateless
Stateful services, i.e. services which store temporary information in private or even public variables, are hard to reason about and are typically a code smell. Various issues arise when using stateful services:

What happens when the service is used by two components on the same page?
Is the state correctly reset at some point?
Is memory being leaked?
Is the page bookmarkable?
Are the browser controls, i.e. forward and backward buttons, behaving the way they are supposed to?
How can the service be unit tested?
